Data files accompanying "Mortality Change Among Less Educated Americans" (Paul Novosad, Charlie Rafkin and Sam Asher) AEJ Applied October 2022

mortality_by_ed_group.dta:
----------------------------

The file contains unadjusted nation-wide annual mortality estimates,
  by cause, age group, race, sex and education level.

mortality_by_percentile.xlsx: 
------------------------------
The file contains bounds on mortality change, by cause, age group,
  race, sex and education percentile group. The normalized change
  divides the level change in mortality from a given cause by baseline
  (1992-1994) all-cause mortality. The number thus represents the
  percentage change in all-cause mortality that is accounted for by
  changes in the listed cause.

Code calculating bounds on mortality in constant education percentiles can
