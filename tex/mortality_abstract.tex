Measurements of mortality change among less educated Americans can be biased because the least educated groups (\textit{e.g.} dropouts) become smaller and more negatively selected over time. We show that mortality changes at constant education \textit{percentiles} can be bounded with minimal assumptions. Middle-age mortality increases among non-Hispanic whites from 1992--2018 are driven almost entirely by the bottom 10\% of the education distribution. Drivers of mortality change differ substantially across groups. Deaths of despair explain most of the mortality change among young non-Hispanic whites, but less among older whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Our bounds are applicable in many other contexts.
