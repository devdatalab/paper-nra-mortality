\scriptsize{Note: ``White'' refers to non-Hispanic white. The graph decomposes the change in total mortality from 1992--1994 to 2016--2018 into two parts: the change in total deaths driven by deaths of despair, and the change in total deaths driven by all other causes. Estimates are disaggregated by age, sex, race, and constant percentile education bin. The orange lines show bounds on the contribution to total mortality change driven by changes in deaths of despair. The value on the $Y$ axis is the amount that total mortality for each group would have changed if the rates of all deaths \textit{other} than deaths of despair were unchanged. The gray lines show the contribution to total mortality change driven by all causes of death \textit{other} than deaths of despair. Deaths of despair are deaths from suicide, poisoning, and chronic liver disease. The faded lines show changes from 1992--1994 to 2013--2015, consistent with the prior manuscript.

The figure is analogous to Panel A of Figure 6, but with different bounding assumptions. Panel A defines education bins boundaries according to education levels in 1992--1994. Panel B defines an individual's education percentile according to the individual's rank in the own-race and own-gender education distribution, rather than in the own-gender education distribution. Panel C allows sheepskin effects, by allowing kinks and discrete jumps at education boundaries (e.g. the rank separating dropouts from high school completers). Panel D estimates bounds on mortality without restricting the curvature of the mortality-education CEF.  The lines show the bounded set containing the percentage change in the mortality rate from 1992--1994 to 2016--2018 for the given group.}
