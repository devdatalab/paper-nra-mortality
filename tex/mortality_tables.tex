\footnotesize{Note: ``White'' refers to non-Hispanic white and
  ``black'' refers to non-Hispanic black. The table shows bounds on
  mortality in 1992--94 (Panel A) and 2016--18 (Panel B) at various
  ranks or rank ranges in the education distribution. The notation $Y(x=i)=E(Y|x=i)$
  describes mortality at education percentile $i$, and $\mu_a^b$
  describes average mortality between education percentiles $a$ and
  $b$. $\overline{C}$ is the maximum percentage change in mortality
  function curvature allowed in any one percentile that does not
  correspond to an education bin boundary. Sources: ACS, CPS, and NCHS}

\footnotesize{Note: ``White'' refers to non-Hispanic white and
  ``black'' refers to non-Hispanic black. The table shows the percent
  change in all-cause mortality, defined as total deaths in a year
  divided by population. To hold the population distribution constant,
  we weight the age-specific mortality rates from the data with the
  standardized U.S. population distribution for ages 25--69. We use
  age-specific mortality rates from each period, but a single set of
  weights for all periods.}
