  \footnotesize{Note: The table shows the distribution of causes of
    death for individuals aged 25--69 in 2018. Categories are defined
    by major headings in the ICD-10 Cause-Of-Death lists. The
    categories of cancer, heart disease and deaths of despair are
    pooled across subcategories following the previous literature. See
    Appendix~\ref{sec:app_data} for additional details.}

\begin{landscape}
  \begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Age-Adjusted Changes in Mortality by
      Education Percentile and Cause \cnewline Ages 25--69, 1992--1994
      to 2016--2018}
    \label{tab:all_cause_all_age}
    \input{\mortalitypath/all_cause_std}
  \end{table}
  \footnotesize{ Note: The table shows age-adjusted percentage change
    in mortality from 1992--1994 to 2016--2018 for individuals aged 25
    to 69, by race, gender and education percentile bin. Each table
    entry shows the upper and lower bound on the percentage change in
    mortality over the sample period for the given cause and
    population subgroup. Ages are adjusted with a standardized
    U.S. population distribution, which holds constant that age
    distribution of the population across all years. Education
    percentile bins approximately describe the 2003 distribution of
    education across four categories: high schools dropouts
    (percentiles 0--10), high school graduates (10--45), some college
    (45--70) and B.A. or higher (70--100).}

    show bounds on age-adjusted mortality change from 1992--1994 to
    2016--2018 for a standardized population, as in
    Table~\ref{tab:mort_changes}. The four education groups represent
    education percentiles (i) 0--10; (ii) 10--45; (iii) 45--70; and (iv) 70--100.
    The points in the graph show naive estimates of mortality rates at
    fixed education \textit{levels}; the four education levels for the
    points represent (i) high school dropouts; (ii) high school
    completers; (iii) some college; and (iv) a B.A. or higher.}
