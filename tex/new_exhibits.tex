  Figure~\ref{fig:naive_vs_bounds} shows mortality changes for 50--54-year-old women from 1992--94 to 2016--18 (all races combined), calculated under different methods. The points show unadjusted estimates for women at constant education levels---dropouts in Panel A and high school graduates in Panel B. Both of these population groups have shrunk as proportions of the population during the sample period. The vertical bars show bounds on mortality change in constant rank bins---ranks 0--10 in Panel A and ranks 11--45 in Panel B.
